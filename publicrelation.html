                <h2>Understand Public Relations!</h2>
                <p>
                    As small business owners, we try our best to manage everything from planning to execution and squeeze our shoestring budgets
                    as far as they will go to find new opportunities for our brands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Public relations for small business are dominant because it helps you to get more exposure and it places you in front of
                    your target audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some people think of PR as ‘free advertising’ which couldn’t be farther from the truth. Building relationships with the right
                    people and organizations are time-consuming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So if you need quicker results, you should go to a PR agency (they do cost $$$). Most bloggers and influencers now charge
                    for reviews, promoted posts and featured posts, so PR is not free.
                </p>

        <div class="col-md-12 second">
            <h2>Why are Public Relations essential for any brand?</h2>
            <div class="col-md-6 service-content-1">
                <h4>To raise awareness:</h4>
                <p>
                    People trust established brands. One way to make your business known and compete with established brands is to send out your
                    message by a third party such as a favorite magazine in your industry, a high-traffic website, a respected
                    influencer or social media superstar.
                </p>
                <h4>Build credibility:</h4>
                <p>
                     Unlike advertising, a magazine mention of your product or a product review is not a direct sell so it comes out as a recommendation
                    from a person that could be an authority in your niche like a celebrity beauty blogger with thousands of followers.
                </p>
                <h4>Tailors information:</h4>
                <p>
                     Every business has its unique brand message. People adore brands that have a compelling or relatable story so make sure
                    that you carry yours wholeheartedly at every function you go to because it is what makes people remember you.
                </p>
                <h4>Helps manage reputation:</h4>
                <p>
                     Having trusted connections in the media is not always about free marketing but also reputation management. In your business
                    journey, you will encounter (but I hope you don’t) terrible situations like advertising went wrong or unsatisfied customers
                    lashing out on social media about how bad your product is. In times like these, media connections can help you repair the
                    damage through a press release or similar means.
                </p>
                <h4>Helps shape a likable image:</h4>
                <p>Customers love friendly and community-engaged brands. By maintaining a constant presence in your industry or front your customers’
                eyes, you are creating a secure connection with your audience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 service-content-1">
                <h4>Cost-effective:</h4>
                <p>
                     Paying for a magazine spread is not a bad idea if you have the budget for it. However, if you are on a tight budget, having
                    friends in the right places can get you a full feature or an article mention in the same publication without paying loads
                    of cash.
                </p>
                <h4>Promote brand values:</h4>
                <p>
                     You can use PR to send out positive messages to your target audience that are in line with your brand image by using the
                    language and ideas that your target customers respond to more positively.
                </p>
                <h4>Strengthens community relations:</h4>
                <p>
                     When you make new connections, you are building ties with the local market by attending functions, joining groups, donating
                    time to charity or causes related to your business. Being an active member of a community establishes your credibility with
                    peers, consumers, and editorial contacts.
                </p>
                <h4>Boost your niche authority:</h4>
                <p>
                     Getting featured on media outlets may come out as simple to many, but for a business owner, the effect could be massively
                    beneficial especially if you are trying to own a niche.
                </p>
                <h4>Know your competition up-close and personal:</h4>
                <p>You are not the only one who spends time in making new connections. It’s one way of knowing what your competitors are up
                to, which gives you clues how to keep up with them.</p>
                <p>
                     PR is not free in the sense that it requires time and effort in making new connections. It may seem labor intensive, but
                    if your business does this right, it will help your company look more likable, influential, and successful.
                </p>
